# Schema — Intelligent Placeholder Generator

Schema is a plugin for Figma that helps designers generate more realistic placeholder text. There are a few plugins available already that do similar things, but I wanted a plugin that would let me do more advanced things like date/time sequences, interpolating variables, and using custom scripts to generate copy.

It's mainly here to scratch my own itch and learn to create Figma plugins, but I'll hopefully push it to production soon.

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v14
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing a JavaScript bundle for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the development plugin

In the Figma desktop app:

1. Open a Figma document.
2. Go to `Plugins` → `Development` → `New Plugin…`.
3. Click the `Click to choose a manifest.json file` box, and select the `manifest.json` file that was generated.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console in the Figma desktop app, go to `Plugins` → `Development` → `Open Console`.
